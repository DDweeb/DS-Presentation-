# Presentation on File Organisation 

We have created a presentation that reports us about the concept of File Organisation . File Organisation refers to the ways or methods used to store and access records of the file on storage medium . 

Furthermore , we have discussed about the File Organisation Selection . It depends primarily on the type of operation that are to allowed . The same has been explained with the visual representation of charts in the presentation which helps in eludicating the topic much better . 

The primary access methods includes :-
-Serial File Organisation
-Sequential File Organisation 

These two have been explained in detail in presentation using theory as well as charts . 

At last we have described the operations of Sequential file . Briefly these are :
                                     -Creation of Sequentially organised files 
                                     -Opening a file 
                                     -Closing a file 
                                     -Retrieving from sequential file
                                     -Appending a sequential file
                                     -Updating a sequential file

With this we have enclosed our presentation .


 A report giving the brief summary of our presentation has also been attached to this presentation . It includes Executive Summary of our topic , Introduction to File Organisation and Limitations to it .
