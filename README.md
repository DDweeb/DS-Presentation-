# Presentation on File Organisation 

We have created a presentation that reports us about the concept of File Organisation . File Organisation refers to the ways or methods used to store and access records of the file on storage medium . 

Furthermore , we have discussed about the File Organisation Selection . It depends primarily on the type of operation that are to allowed . The same has been explained with the visual representation of charts in the presentation which helps in eludicating the topic much better . 

The primary access methods includes :-
1) Serial File Organisation
2) Sequential File Organisation


These two have been explained in detail in presentation using theory as well as charts . 

At last we have described the operations of Sequential file . Briefly these are :
1) Creation of Sequentially organised
2) Opening a file 
3) Closing a file 
4) Retrieving from sequential file
5) Appending a sequential file
6) Updating a sequential file

With this we have enclosed our presentation .


 A report giving the brief summary of our presentation has also been attached to this presentation . It includes Executive Summary of our topic , Introduction to File Organisation and Limitations to it .
